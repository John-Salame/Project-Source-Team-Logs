Meeting log 09-18-2019

Spent time looking for possible data sets for the Farm Source idea.  After determining that we couldn't find an appropriate data set for the project we discussed our other project ideas.  We discussed the Electronic Medical Record proposal and determined that it wasn't a good fit for this project.  We then voted between the Project Database proposal and the Course Helper proposal and selected the Project Database proposal.
